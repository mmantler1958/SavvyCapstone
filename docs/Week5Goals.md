# Homework and Goals

## Goal: _Mastery of these Skills_

- HTML forms and form handling with and without Formspree
- CSS responsive styling, media queries, and positioning with flexbox
- Be able to explain Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Create JS Objects with `function` Constructors, create JS classes, and extending prototypes

<br>

## Goal: _Capstone work_

- Add a form to your capstone and activate it through Formspree
- Optimize capstone styling to be Mobile-First and Responsive by using Media Queries and Flexbox
- Find an API online from which you can consume data into your project (like the weather app, Google maps, or WebMD etc.) EG:- [Collection of Free Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#public-apis--)
- Also add `normalize.css`, Google fonts, a collapsible Nav Bar Hamburger Icon w/ Font Awesome, and a Jumbotron/Hero header (if needed)

## Homework is due to your TA by next Monday before class

### JS Array Methods Practice

Using the [placeholder User data](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users):

- create and print a list of phone numbers
- create and print a list of website and email pairs (pair them in a string, array, or object)

<br>

Using the [placeholder To-Do data](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos):

- create a list of user 9's to-dos
- then find the number of user 9's incomplete tasks

<br>

Using the [placeholder Post data](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts):

- create a list of user 5's posts
- then, create a list of title and body pairs

<br>

### Bonus Challenge

Using the [placeholder To-Do data](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos):

- create an object that summarizes the incomplete tasks of users 3, 7, & 8
  - ex:
  ```javascript
  {
    user3: {
      totalTasks: x,
      totalIncomplete: y,
      incompleteTasks: [title1, title2, title3, ...]
    },
    user7: ...
  }
  ```

'nam quidem est ducimus sunt debitis saepe'
},

### JS Classes & Constructors Practice

In a .js file, create a few classes. Create one "general category" class, then two more specific classes which extend from the first class.

For example: Perhaps you are creating a web store that sells video games and game consoles.

- You could create a general `Item` class to hold properties that any and every item for sale shares in common, like `id`, `name`, or `price`.
- Then, extend `Item` with a class for `GameConsoles` and a class for `VideoGames` and include properties specific to each _category_ of item.

### CSS Media Queries Practice

Included in week 5 homework is the `index.html` file from a site about Andre the Giant.

In the `styles.css` file, fix the styling for the site, and create a media query that fixes the site to correctly display on the "iPhone 6/7/8" view in DevTools.

Focus on the following:

- The `#bio` `<ul>` at the top of the page
- `<img>` tags
- `<div>` tags
- links

> TIP: you may want to copy-paste some already existing css rules into your media query to make sure you are overwriting the necessary rules.
