**Definition**  
For my full stack capstone project at Savvy Coders, I would like to create a web application that will assist a person with complying to their medication regimen.
It will have the ability for the medication user to configure their regimen or by a person's friend or family member.  This allows flexibility of implementation based on the 
compliance of the medication user (MU).  For eaxmple, an older person may require a friend or family member to administer the configuration.

**Audience**
1. A medication user that has issues remembering to take their medications on time or at all. In this case the medication user will configure the regimen themselves.
2. Family members or friends of a medication user are also targeted. Based on the severity of the person's compliance with their medication(s), family members or friends can configure and miantain the configuration for them.  For eaxmple, an older person may require a friend or family member to administer the configuration.

**High level story** 
Do you know anyone that has issues complying with their medication, either themselves or for a friend/family member? I have a solution that is free to use. Would you like to know more?

**Outline of the Application**
1. Home Page:
A home page will provide a brief description of the application and its applicability.  It will also have a disclaimer of liabilty.

2. Medications:
A medication page will list all the medications a person takes.  It will store the medication name including its strength and dosage form.

3. Schedule:
A scheduling page will list each medication along with the number of doses and when its supposed to be taken (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).

4. Contacts:
A contacts page will allow entry of contact information (name/phone/email,contact type) for all parties associated with the configuration.  Each contact will be marked as the MU (medication user) or helper (the medication buddy that watches for compliance). 

5. Optional:
If time permits, a page will be added that will summarize any drug interactions amongst the current medications.

**User Flow**
1. Their are two types of roles; View Only (VO) and Administrator (ADM).
2. Administrator:  The administator will maintain the mediciations list and schedule.
3. View Only:  The view only role will alow view only of any and all data in the application.
