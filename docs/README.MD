**Definition**  
For my full stack capstone project at Savvy Coders, I would like to create a web application that will assist a person with complying to their medication regimen.
It will have the ability for the medication user to configure their regimen or by a person's friend or family member.  This allows flexibility of implementation based on the 
compliance of the medication user (MU).  For eaxmple, an older person may require a friend or family member to administer the configuration.

**Audience**
1. A medication user that has issues remembering to take their medications on time or at all. In this case the medication user will configure the regimen themselves.
2. Family members or friends of a medication user are also targeted. Based on the severity of the person's compliance with their medication(s), family members or friends can configure and miantain the configuration for them.  For eaxmple, an older person may require a friend or family member to administer the configuration.
